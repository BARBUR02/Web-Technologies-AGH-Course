# Web-Technologies-AGH-Course

## **Each lab starts with sort of easier tasks and scales to a larger projects in the latest exercises**. 
## lab_02 
I learned HTML/CSS and responsive design using media queries. Probably most time consuming lab due to limitations of using only html and css to perform tasks.
## lab_03 
I learned JS and it's usage in creating dynamic web apps. Last 2 exercises in this lab are small projects: Zombie game with highscores loaded from JSOB blob
(12) and dynamic table of countries in their subregion with ability to search and sort data by given filters  
## Lab_04 
It was my start with Angular framework, aim was to perform simple tasks in the beginning and then use new skills and knowledge in project app which will be developed by next 3 labs
## lab_05 
... more angular tasks, and futher development of project, which will be later connected to firebase in order to get rid of local data storage. Final project is places in different repo
